Project that will maintain the event website of Laws of Social Cohesion

Written in Python and SQL (via pymysql). The code still needs to be modularized and I will add a proper readme later this month.
Deployed on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance with Apache and Django using AWS RDS for the database. Moving into production around the end of April
